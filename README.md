# CI301-BrightonIceAge

This project aims to depict **Brighton(UK)** in the **Ice Age** along with the time's numerous inhabitants and 'technologies'. As this is a final year project, time constraints and technical ability will inevitably prevent this project from becoming fully implemented.

This project utilises BabylonJS as a game engine to render 3D graphics via the web browser.

# Requirements

In order to run this project you will need NodeJS and a WebGL enabled web browser. 

* Install NodeJS
* Clone this repository
* Via CMD, navigate to the directory
* Use `npm install` to install the required packages
