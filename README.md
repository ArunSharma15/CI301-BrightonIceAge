# CI301-BrightonIceAge

This project aims to depict **Brighton(UK)** in the **Ice Age** along with the time's numerous inhabitants and 'technologies'. As this is a final year project, time constraints and technical ability will inevitably prevent this project from becoming fully implemented.

This project utilises BabylonJS as a game engine to render 3D graphics via the web browser.

# Requirements

In order to run this project you will need NodeJS and a WebGL enabled web browser (Do not use internet explorer). 

* Install NodeJS
* Clone this repository
* Via CMD, navigate to the directory
* Use `npm install` to install the required packages
* Enter `npm run start` to run the project
* Use `localhost:5000` to view the results via a web browser.

A 'build' folder in 'js' needs to be added and an 'image' folder (in the project root) which contains all relevant textures and images.

# Current Features:

* Contains 5 'stages' which examine an element of the ice age.
* Stages consist of UI, Models and sound effects.
* Features a variety of animations.
